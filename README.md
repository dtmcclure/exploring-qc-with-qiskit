# Exploring Quantum Computing with Qiskit

These step-by-step instructions will guide you through running your first quantum program on a real quantum computer. The only pre-requisite is an account on the IBM Quantum Experience (http://ibm.co/iqx).

# Landing page

Below is an example of the page you'll see upon logging in to the IBM Quantum Experience website. In the middle are large buttons for launching the **composer** (for programming with a GUI) and **notebooks** (for programming with Qiskit); if a list of recent items appears instead of these buttons, the quick-access toolbar mentioned below can be used instead. Toward the bottom, you'll find lists of pending and completed **jobs**. On the right you'll find a list of quantum **backends** (i.e. real quantum devices or quantum simulators) to which you have access. Finally on the left you'll find a vertical toolbar for quick access to various resources.

# Writing your first quantum program

Click the "Qiskit Notebooks" icon from the landing page or the quick-access toolbar, which will take you to the page shown below:

This page provides four options: load a pre-loaded tutorial notebook, create a new notebook from scratch, import a notebook from your computer, or load a previously saved notebook. Click "New Notebook" to create your own notebook from scratch.

A new notebook will load. As shown below, the first cell is already populated with code that loads some useful tools, so you're not working completely from scratch.
